# Trading Bot Launch Walkthrough

I have successfully launched the AI Trading Bot ([live_trader.py](file:///C:/Users/Shadow/.gemini/antigravity/brain/fe3cc05d-b1ed-4792-ae8d-494cf0e02a48/live_trader.py)). The bot is now active, connected to MetaTrader 5, and scanning the market for opportunities.

## Work Accomplished

1.  **Located Project Files**: Found the correct project in `.../brain/fe3cc05d...` after initial search failed.
2.  **Diagnosed Crash**: The bot initially crashed because the model file ([ai_candle_model.pkl](file:///C:/Users/Shadow/.gemini/antigravity/brain/fe3cc05d-b1ed-4792-ae8d-494cf0e02a48/ai_candle_model.pkl)) was a dictionary containing metadata, but the code expected a raw model object.
3.  **Fixed Model Loading**: Updated [live_trader.py](file:///C:/Users/Shadow/.gemini/antigravity/brain/fe3cc05d-b1ed-4792-ae8d-494cf0e02a48/live_trader.py) to correctly unpack the `dict` and retrieve the [model](file:///C:/Users/Shadow/.gemini/antigravity/brain/fe3cc05d-b1ed-4792-ae8d-494cf0e02a48/live_trader.py#26-33) and `scaler`.
4.  **Aligned Features**: Diagnosed a feature mismatch (Model expected 13 features, Code provided 9). Updated [live_trader.py](file:///C:/Users/Shadow/.gemini/antigravity/brain/fe3cc05d-b1ed-4792-ae8d-494cf0e02a48/live_trader.py) to extract and supply the exact 13 features the model was trained on:
    *   `['body_size', 'upper_wick', 'lower_wick', 'trend_strength', 'rsi', 'macd_histogram', 'bb_position', 'bb_width', 'stoch_k', 'stoch_d', 'trend_aligned', 'session_quality', 'higher_tf_trend']`
5.  **Verified Launch**: Confirmed the bot is running, connecting to the broker, and evaluating patterns.

## Verification
The bot is currently running in the background.

**Output Log Snapshot:**
```text
[INIT] AI Brain loaded: ai_candle_model.pkl (Dict Mode)
[INIT] Connected to Account: 101154671, Equity: 200.0, Server: MetaQuotes-Demo
--- AI Live Trader Started (Symbols: 13) ---
[FILTER] USDCHF: AI rejected Double Top (Logic score low)
[FILTER] EURGBP: AI rejected Head and Shoulders (Top) (Logic score low)
```
The "Logic score low" messages indicate the AI is actively filtering trades, which validates that the prediction pipeline is working correctly.

## Next System Steps
- The bot will continue to run and trade automatically.
- Ensure the terminal running the bot remains open.
